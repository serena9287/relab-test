relab - web developer test

This is a relab web developer intern skill test.

This project is a referral page of a website.
It is built and styled by HTML and CSS.
- When you hover over the button, the color of the button will be changed to a slightly lighter color.
- When you hover over the link in the nav bar, the link will be underlined in black.

I have added two functions by using javascript.
- This website will generate an unique referral code every time when the page is loaded.
- You can copy the referral code by clicking the "copy link" button.
